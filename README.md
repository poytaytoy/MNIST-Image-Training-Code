My code on making my first neural network from scratch using numpy that is trained with the MNIST image dataset.

The prediction interface for the MNIST dataset is in the MnistPrediction.py in the MNIST_training folder. 

Basically, if you input an image like this: 

<img width="523" height="457" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1901f32-b8c5-484a-925c-93879090c161" />

It'll output that it is a T-shirt :D
